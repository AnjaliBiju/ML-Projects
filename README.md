# ðŸ§  Predicting Advertisement Clicks using User Behavior Data

This project aims to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on their behavior and demographic data. We use **Logistic Regression**, a powerful and interpretable classification algorithm, to perform binary prediction (click or no click).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes features like:

- Daily Time Spent on Site
- Age
- Area Income
- Daily Internet Usage
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Timestamp of Ad Display
- Ad Click (Target: 1 = Clicked, 0 = Not Clicked)

---

## ðŸ§ª Features Extracted

From the `Timestamp` column, extracted:
- `Hour` of the day
- `Month` of the year

Dropped irrelevant columns like `Ad Topic Line`, `City`, `Country`, and `Timestamp` to improve model performance.
